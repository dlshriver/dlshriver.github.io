description: "A framework for verifying deep neural networks. Given a neural network and a specification over its behavior, verification checks whether the specification is true or false. DNNV standardizes the network and property specification formats and performs network simplification and property reduction, facilitating verifier execution, comparison, and artifact re-use."
