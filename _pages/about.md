Bio
===

I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, advised by [Sebastian Elbaum](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/sebastian-elbaum) and [Matt Dwyer](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/matthew-b-dwyer), and a member of [LESS lab](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/). 
I have a BS in computer engineering and a Masters in computer science from UNL. 
My Masters work was on assessing the quality and stability of recommender systems. 
My current research interests are in *analysis, testing, and verification of machine learning systems*, especially in the context of cyber-physical systems.

Research Interests
===
My research interests are in ensuring correctness of machine learning systems. In particular, I am interested in how we can adapt software engineering methodologies for quality assurance, such as program analysis, testing, and verification, to systems that use machine learning components.
