title: "DNNF: Deep Neural Network Falsification"
excerpt: "DNNF is a tool for applying falsification methods such as adversarial attacks to the checking of DNN correctness problems. Adversarial attacks provide a powerful repertoire of scalable algorithms for property falsification. DNNF leverages these techniques by employing reductions to automatically transform correctness problems into equivalent sets of adversarial robustness problems, to which these attacks can then be applied."

DNNF is a tool for applying falsification methods such as adversarial attacks to the checking of DNN correctness problems.
Adversarial attacks provide a powerful repertoire of scalable algorithms for property falsification.
DNNF leverages these techniques by employing reductions to automatically transform correctness problems into equivalent sets of adversarial robustness problems, to which these attacks can then be applied.
