bio: "<span class='no-print'></span> I work to make machine learning systems safer and more reliable, especially in applications where failures can have serious consequences, such as autonomous vehicles or safety-critical systems. My research develops practical tools and techniques for analyzing, verifying, and fixing neural networks, ensuring failures are caught and remediated before they can have a significant impact."
