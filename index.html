			I am nearing completion of my site. I don't always have much time to work on it, so it has been pretty slow. I've been working on the pages for projects and posts. Hopefully they'll be ready soon. I've also added a contact page, but it is pretty sparse at the moment, but will do for now.

					<h2>Posts</h2><h3>10</h3><h4>Apr 2014</h4><p>
			I had a few minutes today so I addded dates to the latest sections on the main page. My next step will be to set up the Posts and Projects pages to display content. This shouldn't be too difficult, but I don't have enough time to build it today, so we'll save it for another time.

			I have started working on getting a system set up for posts and projects. I currently don't have much content on here, but that will come soon after I finish getting everything else ready. This project is a test to make sure that content on the front page is correctly formatted. I just copied the description from the post.
