short_description: "A tool for deep neural network falsification."
description: "A tool for applying falsification methods such as adversarial attacks to checking of DNN correctness problems. Adversarial attacks provide a powerful repertoire of scalable algorithms for falsification of robustness properties. DNNF employs reductions to automatically transform general DNN correctness problems into equivalent sets of adversarial robustness problems, to which these attacks can then be applied."
