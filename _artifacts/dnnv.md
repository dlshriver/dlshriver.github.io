title: "DNNV: Deep Neural Network Verification"
excerpt: "DNNV is a framework for verifying deep neural networks (DNN). DNN verification takes in a neural network, and a property over that network, and checks whether the property is true, or false. DNNV standardizes the network and property input formats to enable multiple verification tools to run on a single network and property. This facilitates both verifier comparison, and artifact re-use."

DNNV is a framework for verifying deep neural networks (DNN). 
DNN verification takes in a neural network, and a property over that network, and checks whether the property is true, or false. 
DNNV standardizes the network and property input formats to enable multiple verification tools to run on a single network and property. 
This facilitates both verifier comparison, and artifact re-use.
